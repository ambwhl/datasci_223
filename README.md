# Self introduction
Hi, my name is Amber(Hailiang Wu). I got my PhD in bioengineering from the University of Tokyo, then worked a few years in academia before working as a bioinformatic scientist in biotech companies focusing on precision medicine in oncology.
Ñow I am pursuing my master’s degree in health data science to gain a systematic knowledge in data science. 
In my previous position, I developed several automated NGS pipelines including WES and WGS.
I aim to systematically learn Python and prepare myself for a technical interview at a LeetCode medium difficulty level.
